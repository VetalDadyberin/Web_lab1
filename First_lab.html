                <p>This comedian is perhaps the most influential comedian in the world - the level of Arkady Raikin in the USSR. He could have made a career as a director, but went to stand-up to become not one of many, but the only and special. The career was hard at first, but today Luis C.K. (Louis Si Kay) is the highest paid comedian on the planet. With the direction, by the way, everything also worked out more than successfully. And this superman comes to Kiev - this is unthinkable, friends! Luis C.K. Concert Live in Kiev will be held May 15, 2020 at 19:30 in the Palace "Ukraine". Will there be more performances? It is unlikely, because the Maestro is waiting in another thousand cities on Earth. But just in case, let’s inform: all the tickets for the concerts of Luis C.K. Look on the comedian’s personal page, which we created specifically for the first landmark visit of the star of humor.

                  P.S. If you do not know English, it does not matter. You can purchase a headset right on the spot, into which a specially trained person will transfer you.
                  </p>
                  <p> Do not confuse God's gift with talent

                    That Louis talent became known in the early childhood of the artist. All that remained open was the question in which direction the guy would prove himself. He immediately went smoothly with the cinema - after the first short film, Xi Kei was offered a big project. However, he refused, deciding to build a career on TV and in stand-up. The debut on stage was a failure. The comedian was very upset by the failure, so he did not speak for some time, but wrote scripts and jokes for others. And then he came up with the “special” format when the comedian’s performance is recorded on video, and then shown on TV or the digital version is distributed.

                    Thus, our today's hero can be called not just a talent, but a genius. And getting into a live performance of the artist has become a subject of special chic. Buy a concert ticket for Luis C.K. Live in Kiev, we recommend in advance. It is possible that stand-ups from all over the post-Soviet space - both venerable and beginners - will rush to the capital of Ukraine. By the way, this “trick” with “special” was adopted by other comedians of the planet, which greatly facilitated their access to a wide audience.
                  </p>
                  <p>What is Sei Kay joking about?
                    First you need to say how he does it. We must prepare the audience: D So, the Maestro uses triple punch-line. It’s like a triple sheepskin coat in figure skating or the Triple Strike movie with Van Damme - imagine that the hero does not have two legs, like all Cro-Magnons, but three. Or imagine that the hero of Van Damme has something that looks great on his third leg - as strong, thick and muscular as his right or left leg. Speaking more clearly, Sea Kay first makes you laugh a little, then after a second or two you ride with laughter, and after a couple of seconds you cry like the heroes of the film “Man from the Capuchin Boulevard” in the most ridiculous moment. As for the topic of jokes. That CK draws them from life, inventing absolutely nothing. Yes, the Maestro makes laugh with the truth of life, but he does it better than anyone in the world.

                    If you decide to buy a concert ticket for Luis C.K. Live in Kiev, you should familiarize yourself with one more nuance: THIS SHOW IS FREE FROM PHONES!

                    When you go to the venue of the West, the phone will be placed in a special Yondr case;
                    After placing the phone inside, the cover will be locked. You keep your phone inside during the whole show.
                    Order and buy tickets for "Louis C.K. (Louis C. Key) Live in Kiev in English" with Louis C.K. (Louis Sea Key), in the city of Kiev (Palace Ukraine). You can at tickethunt. The event will be held on May 15, 2020 19:30.

          <p>Louis C.K., byname of Louis Szekely, (born September 12, 1967, Washington, D.C., U.S.), American comedian, writer, director, and producer known for his ribald confessional stand-up comedy and for his television show Louie.<br>

            Szekely was raised in Mexico City until age seven, when his family moved to Massachusetts. In elementary school he began styling his name “Louis C.K.,” using a phonetic rendering of his surname. After graduating from high school, he worked as an auto mechanic while trying out stand-up comedy routines at Boston-area open-mike nights. In 1989 C.K. moved to New York City, where he continued to hone his stand-up and began making short films.<br>

            He joined the writing staff of Late Night with Conan O’Brien in 1993, beginning a career writing for the television shows of respected comedians such as Conan O’Brien, David Letterman, and Chris Rock. C.K. won an Emmy Award in 1999 for his work on The Chris Rock Show, and in 2001 he wrote and directed the eccentric feature film Pootie Tang, a box-office disappointment that later earned a cult following. He also was a writer on the Rock-starring films Down to Earth (2001) and I Think I Love My Wife (2007).<br>

            While C.K. was making a name for himself as a writer, his candid stand-up routines grew in popularity and gradually earned him a reputation as a “comic’s comic.” He was known for exploring the darker side of human nature in his stage show—often mining the most intimate details of his personal life for material—and being someone who said the things an audience would not admit to thinking. Aided by his savvy use of the Internet via his blog and oft-proliferated YouTube clips of his performances, C.K. established himself as a prominent U.S.-touring stand-up comedian by the middle of the first decade of the 2000s.<br>

            In 2006 C.K. created, cowrote, and starred in Lucky Louie, a television series on the HBO cable channel that recalled working-class sitcoms of the past, such as The Honeymooners and All in the Family. Lucky Louie met with mixed reviews from critics and lasted just one season before being cancelled.
            In 2010 C.K. created for the FX cable channel a second television series, Louie, an offbeat, loosely structured show that consisted of short, often-surreal narrative segments—which were not always comedic in nature—interspersed with clips of C.K.’s stand-up performances. He had even more creative control in this second attempt at running a television show: he wrote, directed, edited, and starred in the program. Louie was a hit with critics, and C.K. received Emmy Awards for his writing (2012 and 2014) as well as multiple nominations for best lead actor in a comedic series (2011–15). After the show’s fifth season ended in 2015, Louie went on an extended hiatus.<br>

            C.K.’s extremely hands-on approach to his projects extended to his 2011 stand-up special Louis C.K.: Live at the Beacon Theater. He produced, directed, and edited the Emmy-winning special, which, before airing on television, was distributed on C.K.’s Web site for a low price ($5) to make it more accessible to his fans and to discourage illegal downloads. He was widely praised for this novel (for the comedy world, at least) business model. In 2014 C.K. released a feature-length film that he had directed in 1998, Tomorrow Night, via a $5 download from his Web site. C.K. also produced conventionally released audio and video recordings of his stand-up performances. Hilarious (2011) and Live at Madison Square Garden (2015) won Grammy Awards for best comedy album. In 2017 he released a stand-up special through the streaming service Netflix simply called 2017.<br>

            In addition, the comic acted in such films as The Invention of Lying (2009), Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine (2013), and David O. Russell’s American Hustle (2013). C.K. provided the voice of a terrier in the computer-animated children’s comedy The Secret Life of Pets (2016). He had a recurring role on the sitcom Parks and Recreation. C.K. also cocreated and wrote the television show Baskets, which premiered in 2016 and featured Zach Galifianakis as a rodeo clown; created, wrote, directed, and costarred in the Web series Horace and Pete (2016), about the goings-on at a bar; and cocreated and produced the television show Better Things, which began airing in 2016 and follows the struggles of an actress and single mother.<br>

            In November 2017 The New York Times published an article in which a number of women accused C.K. of sexual misconduct. He subsequently stated that their stories were true, and he expressed remorse for his actions. FX ended its association with C.K., and he was removed as producer from such shows as Baskets and Better Things. The fate of Louie was uncertain, though it seemed unlikely to return. In addition, the distributor for I Love You, Daddy (2017)—which C.K. wrote, starred in, and directed—announced that it had canceled the film’s theatrical release. In August 2018 C.K. made a surprise visit to a comedy club in New York City, performing a stand-up routine. Other appearances followed, and his return elicited mixed reactions.<br>
